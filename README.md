# Reflections

A student group contribution markdown blog to reflect on lessons from making apps

## Write down what you've learned

As you create your app and go through multiple iterations as the requirements change, it is good to reflect on what you learned during the process.

Writing down techniques and tips as you learn them is a great habit to get into which will help you during your whole dev career.

This is why a lot of developers have code blogs. 

The purpose a lot of times isn't to grow a large audience of readers, often it is simply to have a central place to collect things you've learned and useul snippets of code as a reference for yourself to revisit in the future.

## Making Group Contributions with Git

When you develop an app for a company, you will be working on a team most of the time. 

You will have to be comfortable making contributions to a central repository that other team members also contribute code to.

We'll practice this by writing a few blog posts for ourselves and commiting them to this central repository!
