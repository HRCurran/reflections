Dragon-clicker App Notes
Revision 1 
I have a basic emoji that can increment once the box with the innerText is clicked on.  To achieve the functionality that is expected, I am experimenting with other coding methods(naming different constructor functions or making use of addEventListener with a div variable declaration).  

Revision 2
I can update the clicks for two dragon emojis of the same type - two separate dragon emojis(containers) two separte counters.

Drawback:
I am having difficulty updating the clicks for two dragon emojis of a different type.  The first trial resulted in the second emoji type reverting back to the original or first emoji type.  With the code that I am currently writing I can update only one emoji between two separate or different emojis.
