# Reflecting on my Experience with Writing the Dragon Clicker
## Dragon Clicker Ideas
- scalability
- ease of understanding for future coders

## Learning from Mistakes
Simple is better. Over-complcating leads to more errors and possibly too much specificity to allow changes and scale.

## Dragon Clicker Duo Ideas
- again, scalability. Did the first project work the same way?
- odds are, client is going to change the scope again. Is the code you've reworked here going to scale again?
- is the code still understandable?

## Omnipresent Mistakes
Remeber that you're learning this as a procedural language. Everything doesn't need to be neat and tidy little chunks for OOP reuse. SIMPLE IS STILL BETTER. You don't always have to build the scalable app first.
