# Reflection on the Dragon Clicker Application

## Version 1
I used onClick on the image source in html to execute some javascript code to update the global variable.
I am impressed how easy it is.

### Learning from Mistakes
Keeping the names straight and location very important.

## Version Duo
I added a new variable and lister to handle a second drgaon.
I also added css code to set background color unique for each version.

### Learning from Mistakes
Spent a lot of time trying to ste the image and css and it can't be done.
