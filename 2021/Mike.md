# Reflection on the Dragon Clicker Application

## Version 1
I used onClick on the image source in html to execute some javascript code to update the global variable.
I am impressed how easy it is.

### Learning from Mistakes
Keeping the names straight and location very important.

## Version Duo
I added a new variable and lister to handle a second drgaon.
I also added css code to set background color unique for each version.

### Learning from Mistakes
Spent a lot of time trying to ste the image and css and it can't be done.

## Version Dragon Clicker Arena
I added five dragons to the application.
The javascript code contains the list of dragons with a type, click total and image.
When the user clicks on a dragon in the icon row the total is updated and a copy of the dragon is displayed in the middle of the screen

### Learning from Mistakes
There's so much to javascript and HTML and there interdependency that making mistakes is easy.
