# Dragon Clicker Project Process Reflections

### July 19, 2021
I used a JS event listener on the dragon button (which was accessed via a query selector) to increment a `value` variable and update the inner text of the output HTML element. It was important to me to use query selectors to reference the important HTML elements, because I figured that I would want to reference those elements more times in the future, if the app scales up in some way.
Brendan's use of the [https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/event_onclick.asp](onclick event) attached to his dragon button in his HTML file was cool to see, and something I want to keep in mind for the future, if the client wants to add different numbers with each click in the future.
